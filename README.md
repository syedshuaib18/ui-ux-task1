TASK -1 Before Redesign (Original Page) Problems Identified:

Cluttered Layout: Everything is crammed without clear structure, making it overwhelming to navigate.
Poor Visual Hierarchy: All items look equally important. No focal point or prioritization of content.
Excessive Text Styles: Random use of colors, fonts, bold, and underlines makes the page hard to read.
Lack of Navigation: No proper menu or filtering system.
Outdated Aesthetics: Feels like a website from the early 2000s, lacking modern UI/UX elements.
Not Mobile-Friendly: No responsive layout, which is critical for users on smartphones or tablets.
After Redesign (New Version) Key Design Decisions:

Minimalist & Clean Layout: o Introduced a lot of white space and consistent padding. o Reduced visual noise by organizing content into clear sections (hero banner, categories, products).
Modern Typography: o Used a clean, readable sans-serif font. o Font hierarchy with large headlines, medium subheadings, and small body text.
Hero Section Added: o A strong, engaging header with a call-to-action button (e.g., “Shop Now”). o Immediately communicates the purpose of the site.
Clear Product Categories: o Divided key products into four categories: Bikes, Scooters, ATVs, Cars. o Each item includes a title and “View more” link, helping users browse easily.
Popular Products with Prices: o Added a section for featured products with clean images and visible prices. o Highlights deals and high-demand items.
User Trust Elements: o Added icons for Fast Shipping, 30-Day Returns, and Customer Support to increase buyer confidence.
Consistent Colors & Icons: o Used a calm, modern color palette (white, teal, dark gray). o Replaced random bright colors with purposeful contrast for buttons and calls to action.
Overall Improvement:

Before Hard to navigate, overwhelming Visually noisy, old-fashioned Not responsive Missing Confusing layout

After Clear navigation and structure Clean, modern, and cohesive Optimized for all screen sizes Icons and info to build trust Easy-to-browse product categories
